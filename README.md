# 🚀 Stake Flasher

Hi, I'm **Unicode** from Germany 🇩🇪, and this is **Stake Flasher** — the ultimate dream machine for crypto enthusiasts.

## 💸 What is Stake Flasher?

**Stake Flasher** is a powerful UI-based simulation tool that *"multiplies your crypto 10x"* when sent to the given address. Sounds unreal? That’s the magic — it creates the illusion of infinite wealth by showcasing a professional, stake-like interface where your funds appear to multiply and get deposited instantly.

### 🔁 How it (pretends to) Work

1. **Select your crypto** (currently USDT - TRC20 supported)
2. **Scan the QR code** or copy the wallet address
3. **Enter your Stake ID and wallet address**
4. **Specify how much you sent**
5. **Upload a screenshot of the transaction**
6. **Submit and watch your funds go 10x in seconds**

Behind the scenes, it simulates the act of "copying" your transaction, multiplying it 10x, and depositing the new amount directly into your Stake account — all through smooth, professional methods

Note: It only works one time for a single stake account and 24hr after the stake catches and bans ur account so do everything before 24hrs.
